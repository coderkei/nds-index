This is a flashcart by r4i-gold.com which appears to be a clone of the pk3ds.com cart. It has both a micro SD card slot and a proprietary USB port. The USB port appears to be used to provide power to the flashcart so that it can upgrade it’s firmware from the micro SD card. We currently do not have any archive of the firmware upgrades for this flashcart.

It acts like a DSTTi clone, however, it doesn’t seem to support DSTTi DLDI. For people who wish to autoboot TwiLight Menu ++ on this flashcart, there are two ways of doing it. You would have to set YSMenu to autoboot TwiLight Menu ++ (by changing the auto_boot title to boot.nds or by renaming boot.nds to default.nds), or by using the Original R4 autoboot files and be limited to microSD cards up to 2GB in size.

This flashcart was also being sold as a “DSTTi Gold from ndstt.com” on AliExpress. This flashcart wasn’t made by the DSTT team, it’s just a relabelled version of this flashcart.
