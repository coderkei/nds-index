This is a flashcart by r4i-gold.com which appears to be a clone of the pk3ds.com cart. It has both a micro SD card slot and a proprietary USB port. The USB port appears to be used to provide power to the flashcart so that it can upgrade it’s firmware from the micro SD card. We currently do not have any archive of the firmware upgrades for this flashcart.

This flashcart was also being sold as a “DSTTi Gold from ndstt.com” on AliExpress. This flashcart wasn’t made by the DSTT team, it’s just a relabelled version of this flashcart.
