This flashcart is a DSTTi-based clone that ships with a timebomb in the stock kernel. This timebomb doesn't cause any permanent damage - it simply stops the kernel from booting until the date is set back. It can be bypassed by using YSMenu or the no-timebomb version of the stock kernel. YSMenu is recommended since the stock kernel has issues with cheats, and doesn't have folder support for file management.

These carts may be seen named as:
- Gold Pro
- RTS Lite
- Dual Core
